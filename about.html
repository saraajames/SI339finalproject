    	<p>Hello, my name is Leah.</p>
    	<p>I'm the girl behind the business and bottles! I am a student at USC who loves crafts and repurposing. Upon graduation I will receive a dual degree in International Relations and Global Business and East Asian languages and cultures, focusing on Mandarin. When I am not studying, I love spending time with my friends, going to the beach, and of course making saucy succulents!</p>
    	<p>The Saucy Succulents was born when I realized how many glass bottles are wasted each day. I wanted to use this waste and turn it into something beautiful. I believe that nothing should be thrown away because it has served its purpose, but we should find it a new purpose. I focus on handcrafted succulents made from used bottles filled with dirt, succulents, and rocks, or wax for candles. Each one is unique! </p>
    	<p>Succulents and candles have a magical way of adding life to a dull space and putting them in a used alcohol container only adds to the character. I look forward to adding a little more magic into your space.</p>
